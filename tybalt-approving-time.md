# Approving time

>users require the 'tapr' claim in their Profile to approve time

After a staff member has submitted a time sheet, the manager they have selected in their settings will be required to approve it. Managers can access time sheets that are pending approval from the *pending* tab at the top of the time sheets section of the app. Managers can either approve ![Approve](https://github.com/stamler/tbte-docs/blob/master/tybalt-images/checkIcon.png) or reject ![Reject](https://github.com/stamler/tbte-docs/blob/master/tybalt-images/deleteIcon.png) each timesheet. Of course an approving manager must verify the contents of the time sheet prior to approving or rejecting it. An approving manager can view a time sheet by clicking its date, which is linked to a details view.

## Some reasons to reject a time sheet

* A time sheet was submitted to you by a person who doesn't report to you
* The submitted time sheet is incomplete
* The time sheet doesn't represent a full week

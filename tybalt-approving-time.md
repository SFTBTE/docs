# Approving time

>users require the 'tapr' claim in their Profile to approve time

After a staff member has submitted a time sheet, the manager they have selected in their settings will be required to approve it. Managers can access time sheets that are pending approval from the *pending* tab at the top of the time sheets section of the app. Managers can either approve or reject each timesheet. Of course an approving manager should absolutely verify the contents of the time sheet meets all of the necessary requirements prior to approving it and reject a time sheet if it isn't perfect.

## Some reasons to reject a time sheet

* A time sheet was submitted to you by a person who doesn't report to you
* The submitted time sheet is incomplete
* The time sheet doesn't represent a full week

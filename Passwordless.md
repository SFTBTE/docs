# Passwordless Multi-Factor Authentication

## About Passwordless Login

After setting up [MFA](https://github.com/tbt-eng/docs/blob/master/MFA.md) on your TBT Engineering acccount using the Microsoft Authenticator app, it is recommended to enable passwordless login. Passwordless login replaces the need to use a password by leveraging your existing mobile device and making both the possession of your device and the knowledge of its PIN or biometric security an integral part of the login process.

Under the passwordless scheme, In order to login to your account, a person must have your mobile device in their possession and also either know your mobile device PIN or be able to access it via biometric authentication. Using passwordless authentication is very similar to using MFA except for a key difference: after you enter your username you are not asked for a password! Instead, you are presented with a challenge in the form of a two-digit number. Your mobile device will then present you three choices of two-digit numbers. To login, you must choose the correct one. In this manner you prove that the owner of the mobile device is approving the login, completing the process.

## Setting up Passwordless

2. In the Microsoft Authenticator app on your mobile device, select the entry for TBT Engineering Ltd. by touching it.

5. If you use your TBT Engineering email address with a personal Microsoft account as well, you will need to select the option for "Work or School account". Most people won't see this choice.

8. You're done! You can verify that you've completed the setup when the TBT Engineering Ltd. Entry now shows the option "Disable phone sign-in" rather than the message shown in Step 3.

# Setting up MFA

1. If you haven't already installed the Microsoft Authenticator app on your mobile device, Go [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/account/authenticator) and install it.

2. If you already have the Microsoft Authenticator app, make sure that any previous setups for TBT Engineering are deleted.

3. From an internet-connected computer, visit [My Security Info](https://aka.ms/mysecurityinfo) and sign in with the username and password provided by IT. Do not do this from the mobile device you're setting up with Microsoft Authenticator.
